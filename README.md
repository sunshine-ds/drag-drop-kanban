## Overview
A student-friendly Kanban board web app with three columns (To Do, In Progress, Done) supporting task creation, drag-and-drop movement, deletion, and visual feedback. Built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML5 drag-and-drop, and modern, responsive CSS using flexbox. Includes MIT license, professional README, and GitHub Pages deployment.

## Requirements
- Repo has MIT license
- README.md is professional and includes usage instructions
- Page has three columns labeled 'To Do', 'In Progress', 'Done'
- Users can add new tasks with a form input and button
- Tasks can be dragged between columns
- Tasks can be deleted with a delete button
- Visual feedback shows during drag operations (e.g., highlight drop zones)
- Uses HTML5 drag and drop API or equivalent
- Responsive layout works on mobile and desktop
- Clean, modern styling with good color scheme

## Build Pipeline
1. Initialize repository and scaffold project — Create repo student-agent/drag-drop-kanban with main branch. Add base files: index.html, index.css, index.js, README.md, LICENSE. Add .gitignore for OS/editor files. Ensure only these app files are used (plus README and LICENSE) to meet constraints.
1. Build semantic HTML structure with three Kanban columns — In index.html, create a header with app title and a task add form (single text input with placeholder and Add button). Below, add a main container using semantic elements with three columns for To Do, In Progress, Done. Each column should have: a heading, a droppable list area with role="list" and data-status attributes (todo, in-progress, done). Task cards will be rendered inside with role="listitem" and draggable="true". Include ARIA labels and visually-hidden text where helpful.
1. Implement modern responsive styling with flexbox and drag states — In index.css, set a clean theme using CSS variables for colors, spacing, and shadows. Use flexbox to lay out three columns side-by-side on desktop and stack vertically on narrow screens (e.g., <= 768px). Style task cards with elevation, rounded corners, and focus outlines. Add drag-and-drop visual feedback: .card.dragging (reduced opacity), .column.drop-target (outline or background highlight) and .column.drop-target.over (stronger highlight). Ensure good color contrast and comfortable touch targets.
1. Code JavaScript: state, rendering, add/delete actions — In index.js, implement app state as an array of task objects {id, text, status}. Load from localStorage on init; save on every change. Implement render() that clears and repopulates each column based on status. Implement addTask(text) to validate non-empty input, create a task with unique id (e.g., Date.now()), default status 'todo', save and re-render. Implement delete via event delegation on column containers listening for clicks on button[data-action="delete"].
1. Wire HTML5 Drag and Drop interactions with visual feedback — Using the Drag and Drop API: on card dragstart, set dataTransfer with task id, add .dragging to the card. On dragend, remove it. On column list dragover, preventDefault and add .drop-target.over for visual feedback; on dragenter/leave toggle .drop-target. On drop, read task id, update its status based on target column's data-status, save, and re-render. Ensure drop feedback is cleared in all cases. Add safeguards for dropping only into valid list containers.
1. Accessibility and UX polish — Add accessible labels and roles: role="form" for the add form, aria-labels for columns (e.g., "To Do column"), role="list" and role="listitem" for lists/items. Ensure buttons are keyboard focusable and have aria-labels (e.g., Delete task). Provide focus-visible outlines. Ensure motion is minimal and users rely on highlight states for drag feedback. Document keyboard limitations (drag via mouse/touch only) in README.
1. Local QA against evaluation checklist — Open index.html in a modern browser. Verify: 1) Three labeled columns render. 2) Adding tasks works and input clears. 3) Tasks display in To Do by default. 4) Dragging a card shows visual feedback and allows dropping into any column. 5) Deleting a task removes it and persists. 6) Refresh persists tasks (localStorage). 7) Layout responsive at 360px and 1440px. 8) Color contrast passes basic checks (use browser devtools). 9) No console errors.
1. Write professional README with usage and docs — Author README.md with sections: Overview, Features, Live Demo (GitHub Pages URL placeholder), Getting Started (clone and open index.html), Usage (adding, dragging, deleting tasks), Keyboard and Accessibility notes, Tech Stack, Project Structure (three files), Persistence (localStorage), Responsive Design, Known Limitations (mobile DnD caveats), License (MIT). Include screenshots section (optional).
1. Apply MIT License — Populate LICENSE with the standard MIT License text and current year and author placeholder (student-agent). Ensure README references MIT.
1. Commit and push initial version — Git add all files, commit with message "feat: initial Kanban board with drag-and-drop" and push to GitHub main branch.
1. Enable GitHub Pages for deployment — In repo settings, enable GitHub Pages with source: Deploy from a branch -> main, root. Wait for build to complete. Record the live URL: https://student-agent.github.io/drag-drop-kanban/
1. Live site verification — Open the live URL. Re-run the evaluation checklist on the deployed site: check columns, adding, dragging with visual feedback, deleting, responsiveness on mobile viewport emulation, and clean styling. Fix and redeploy if discrepancies appear.
1. Tag release and note next steps — Create a v1.0.0 release tag. Open issues for enhancements (optional): reorder within column, keyboard drag support, touch/pointer DnD fallback, color theme toggle.
