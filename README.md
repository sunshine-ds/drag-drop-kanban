## Overview
A student-friendly Kanban board web app with three columns (To Do, In Progress, Done), supporting task creation, drag-and-drop movement, deletion, and visual feedback. Built with vanilla JS, HTML5, and CSS3, styled using Flexbox/Grid, responsive for mobile and desktop, and deployable via GitHub Pages.

## Requirements
- Repo has MIT license
- README.md is professional and includes usage instructions
- Page has three columns labeled 'To Do', 'In Progress', 'Done'
- Users can add new tasks with a form input and button
- Tasks can be dragged between columns
- Tasks can be deleted with a delete button
- Visual feedback shows during drag operations (e.g., highlight drop zones)
- Uses HTML5 drag and drop API or equivalent
- Responsive layout works on mobile and desktop
- Clean, modern styling with good color scheme

## Build Pipeline
1. Create repository and scaffold files — Initialize a new public repository named drag-drop-kanban under student-agent. Add MIT License and a professional README stub. Create app files index.html, index.css, index.js and an assets/ folder with a minimalist favicon.svg referenced by index.html. Commit initial scaffold.
1. Author HTML structure with three Kanban columns — Build semantic HTML: header with title, a task add form (single text input + Add button), and the board section with three columns labeled To Do, In Progress, Done. Each column contains a column header and a task list container set as a drop zone. Reference index.css and index.js and include favicon link.
1. Style the board with modern, responsive CSS — Implement a clean theme using CSS variables. Use CSS Grid for the three-column layout on desktop and a single-column stack on small screens. Style task cards, buttons, and columns. Add classes for drag states (e.g., .dragging on card, .drop-target on column) with clear visual feedback. Ensure good color contrast and comfortable spacing.
1. Implement Kanban logic and drag-and-drop behavior — Write vanilla JS to manage state and interactions: (1) Maintain a state object with arrays for todo, inProgress, done; persist to localStorage. (2) Add task: read input, create task object with unique id, push to To Do, render. (3) Render function to populate each column. (4) Attach HTML5 Drag and Drop: set draggable on cards; handle dragstart/dragend to set dataTransfer and .dragging class; handle dragenter/leave/over/drop on columns to toggle .drop-target and move tasks across columns. (5) Delete task via button on each card and update state. Debounce saves to localStorage for performance.
1. Polish UX and accessibility basics — Add focus styles, aria-labels for buttons, and descriptive titles. Ensure form submit via Enter key works and prevents empty tasks. Provide visually hidden text for delete buttons if using icon-only. Add gentle transition animations for hover/drag states.
1. Write professional README with usage instructions — Complete README.md with project overview, features, tech stack, setup instructions, usage (adding, dragging, deleting tasks), responsiveness note, known limitations (mobile DnD support), and deployment via GitHub Pages. Include screenshots section placeholder and link to live demo URL once deployed.
1. Verify requirements locally against checklist — Open index.html via a local dev server. Manually check: column labels, add task flow, drag between columns, delete button, visual drag feedback, layout responsiveness, and color scheme quality. Fix any defects found.
1. Cross-browser and viewport testing — Test on latest Chrome, Firefox, Safari (or emulators) at widths 360px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px. Confirm DnD works on desktop browsers and layout is responsive on mobile. Note that native DnD may be limited on some mobile browsers; ensure non-breaking behavior.
1. Commit, push, and configure repository settings — Commit all changes with meaningful messages. Push to GitHub on main branch. In repo settings, ensure MIT License is detected and topics include kanban, drag-and-drop, vanilla-js for discoverability.
1. Enable GitHub Pages and deploy — In repository Settings > Pages, set Source to Deploy from a branch: main, root (/). Save and wait for build to finish. Record the live URL: https://student-agent.github.io/drag-drop-kanban/
1. Post-deploy smoke test — Open the live URL and verify assets load over HTTPS, columns render, task creation/drag/delete function correctly, and localStorage persists tasks across reloads. Validate mobile layout on a real device if possible.
1. Announce and document release — Update README with the live demo link. Create a GitHub Release v1.0.0 with summary of features. Share the URL with stakeholders/classroom.
